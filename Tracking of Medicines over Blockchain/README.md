Secure PharmaChain: Ensuring Reliable Medicine Tracking through Blockchain

In today's pharmaceutical supply chain, disparate databases maintained by individual parties lead to a lack of a shared, global system of truth. This absence of a unified record system introduces vulnerabilities, making the entire supply chain susceptible to risks like man-in-the-middle attacks and the proliferation of counterfeit medicines.

Counterfeit drugs pose a critical issue in the realm of pharmacology. According to the Health Research Funding organization, approximately 10-30% of drugs in developing countries are counterfeit, leading to varying, often harmful, side effects. This global dilemma is particularly severe in developing nations, where adherence to drug regulations is lax and nearly one in every ten medicines deviates from safety standards. The advent of online pharmacies further complicates drug safety enforcement, as counterfeit drugs navigate intricate networks, enabling their infiltration into the authentic supply chain.

Addressing these concerns, our project proposes an innovative solution â€” a novel drug supply chain management system based on blockchain technology, executed using Ganache. Serving as a proof of concept, this initiative orchestrates secure drug record transactions on a blockchain, thereby fostering a smart healthcare ecosystem with an impervious drug supply chain.

Key Features:

Decentralized Recordkeeping: Leveraging blockchain's distributed ledger capabilities to ensure every transaction is recorded across the network, reducing the risk of fraudulent activity.
Immutable Transparency: Records once entered into the blockchain cannot be altered, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of drug supply chain data.
Authentication and Verification: Implementing cryptographic techniques to establish the authenticity of medicines at each step of the supply chain, mitigating the threat of counterfeit drugs.
Smart Contracts for Compliance: Deploying smart contracts to automate compliance with drug regulations and streamline supply chain processes, reducing human error.
By creating a secure and tamper-proof repository for drug supply chain data, this project strives to revolutionize pharmaceutical tracking. Through the integration of blockchain technology, we aim to enhance the safety of medicines, protect public health, and contribute to a standardized drug safety ecosystem.

This project is a part of internal assessment for the course "Blockchain Technology."
